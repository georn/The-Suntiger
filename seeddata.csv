systematically browses the World Wide Web typically for the purpose of Web indexing web spidering Web search engines and some other sites use Web crawling or spidering software to update their web content or indices of others sites web content Web crawlers can copy all the pages they visit for later processing by a search engine which indexes the downloaded pages so the users can search much more efficiently Crawlers consume resources on the systems they visit and often visit sites without approval Issues of schedule load and politeness come into play when large collections of pages are accessed Mechanisms exist for public sites not wishing to be crawled to make this known to the crawling agent For instance including a robotstxt file can request bots to index only parts of a website or nothing at all As the number of pages on the internet is extremely large even the largest crawlers fall short of making a complete index For that reason search engines were bad at giving relevant search results in the early years of the World Wide Web before the year This is improved greatly by modern search engines nowadays very good results are given instantly Crawlers can validate hyperlinks and HTML code They can also be used for web scraping see also datadriven programming A Web crawler may also be called a Web spider an ant an automatic indexer or in the FOAF software context a Web scutter A Web crawler starts with a list of URLs to visit called the seeds As the crawler visits these URLs it identifies all the hyperlinks in the page and adds them to the list of URLs to visit called the crawl frontier URLs from the frontier are recursively visited according to a set of policies If the crawler is performing archiving of websites it copies and saves the information as it goes The archives are usually stored in such a way they can be viewed read and navigated as they were on the live web but are preserved as snapshots The archive is known as the repository and is designed to store and manage the collection of web pages The repository only stores HTML pages and these pages are stored as distinct files A repository is similar to any other system that stores data like a modern day database The only difference is that a repository does not need all the functionality offered by a database system The repository stores the most recent version of the web page retrieved by the crawler The large volume implies the crawler can only download a limited number of the Web pages within a given time so it needs to prioritize its downloads The high rate of change can imply the pages might have already been updated or even deleted The number of possible URLs crawled being generated by serverside software has also made it difficult for web crawlers to avoid retrieving duplicate content Endless combinations of HTTP GET URLbased parameters exist of which only a small selection will actually return unique content For example a simple online photo gallery may offer three options to users as specified through HTTP GET parameters in the URL If there exist four ways to sort images three choices of thumbnail size two file formats and an option to disable userprovided content then the same set of content can be accessed with different URLs all of which may be linked on the site This mathematical combination creates a problem for crawlers as they must sort through endless combinations of relatively minor scripted changes in order to retrieve unique content As Edwards et al noted Given that the bandwidth for conducting crawls is neither infinite nor free it is becoming essential to crawl the Web in not only a scalable but efficient way if some reasonable measure of quality or freshness is to be maintained A crawler must carefully choose at each step which pages to visit next The behavior of a Web crawler is the outcome of a combination of policies Given the current size of the Web even large search engines cover only a portion of the publicly available part A study showed even largescale search engines index no more than of the indexable Web a previous study by Steve Lawrence and Lee Giles showed that no search engine indexed more than of the Web in As a crawler always downloads just a fraction of the Web pages it is highly desirable for the downloaded fraction to contain the most relevant pages and not just a random sample of the Web This requires a metric of importance for prioritizing Web pages The importance of a page is a function of its intrinsic quality its popularity in terms of links or visits and even of its URL the latter is the case of vertical search engines restricted to a single toplevel domain or search engines restricted to a fixed Web site Designing a good selection policy has an added difficulty it must work with partial information as the complete set of Web pages is not known during crawling Cho et al made the first study on policies for crawling scheduling Their data set was a pages crawl from the stanfordedu domain in which a crawling simulation was done with different strategies The ordering metrics tested were breadthfirst backlink count and partial Pagerank calculations One of the conclusions was that if the crawler wants to download pages with high Pagerank early during the crawling process then the partial Pagerank strategy is the better followed by breadthfirst and backlinkcount However these results are for just a single domain Cho also wrote his PhD dissertation at Stanford on web crawling Najork and Wiener performed an actual crawl on million pages using breadthfirst ordering They found that a breadthfirst crawl captures pages with high Pagerank early in the crawl but they did not compare this strategy against other strategies The explanation given by the authors for this result is that the most important pages have many links to them from numerous hosts and those links will be found early regardless of on which host or page the crawl originates Abiteboul designed a crawling strategy based on an algorithm called OPIC Online Page Importance Computation In OPIC each page is given an initial sum of cash that is distributed equally among the pages it points to It is similar to a Pagerank computation but it is faster and is only done in one step An OPICdriven crawler downloads first the pages in the crawling frontier with higher amounts of cash Experiments were carried in a pages synthetic graph with a powerlaw distribution of inlinks However there was no comparison with other strategies nor experiments in the real Web Boldi et al used simulation on subsets of the Web of million pages from the it domain and million pages from the WebBase crawl testing breadthfirst against depthfirst random ordering and an omniscient strategy The comparison was based on how well PageRank computed on a partial crawl approximates the true PageRank value Surprisingly some visits that accumulate PageRank very quickly most notably breadthfirst and the omniscient visit provide very poor progressive approximations BaezaYates et al used simulation on two subsets of the Web of million pages from the gr and cl domain testing several crawling strategies They showed that both the OPIC strategy and a strategy that uses the length of the persite queues are better than breadthfirst crawling and that it is also very effective to use a previous crawl when it is available to guide the current one Daneshpajouh et al designed a community based algorithm for discovering good seeds Their method crawls web pages with high PageRank from different communities in less iteration in comparison with crawl starting from random seeds One can extract good seed from a previouslycrawledWeb graph using this new method Using these seeds a new crawl can be very effective A crawler may only want to seek out HTML pages and avoid all other MIME types In order to request only HTML resources a crawler may make an HTTP HEAD request to determine a Web resources MIME type before requesting the entire resource with a GET request To avoid making numerous HEAD requests a crawler may examine the URL and only request a resource if the URL ends with certain characters such as html htm asp aspx php jsp jspx or a slash This strategy may cause numerous HTML Web resources to be unintentionally skipped Some crawlers may also avoid requesting any resources that have a in them are dynamically produced in order to avoid spider traps that may cause the crawler to download an infinite number of URLs from a Web site This strategy is unreliable if the site uses URL rewriting to simplify its URLs Crawlers usually perform some type of URL normalization in order to avoid crawling the same resource more than once The term URL normalization also called URL canonicalization refers to the process of modifying and standardizing a URL in a consistent manner There are several types of normalization that may be performed including conversion of URLs to lowercase removal of and segments and adding trailing slashes to the nonempty path component Some crawlers intend to download as many resources as possible from a particular web site So pathascending crawler was introduced that would ascend to every path in each URL that it intends to crawl For example when given a seed URL of httpllamaorghamstermonkeypagehtml it will attempt to crawl hamstermonkey hamster and Cothey found that a pathascending crawler was very effective in finding isolated resources or resources for which no inbound link would have been found in regular crawling The importance of a page for a crawler can also be expressed as a function of the similarity of a page to a given query Web crawlers that attempt to download pages that are similar to each other are called focused crawler or topical crawlers The concepts of topical and focused crawling were first introduced by Filippo Menczer and by Soumen Chakrabarti et al The main problem in focused crawling is that in the context of a Web crawler we would like to be able to predict the similarity of the text of a given page to the query before actually downloading the page A possible predictor is the anchor text of links this was the approach taken by Pinkerton in the first web crawler of the early days of the Web Diligenti et al propose using the complete content of the pages already visited to infer the similarity between the driving query and the pages that have not been visited yet The performance of a focused crawling depends mostly on the richness of links in the specific topic being searched and a focused crawling usually relies on a general Web search engine for providing starting points An example of the focused crawlers are academic crawlers which crawls freeaccess academic related documents such as the citeseerxbot which is the crawler of CiteSeerX search engine Other academic search engines are Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search etc Because most academic papers are published in PDF formats such kind of crawler is particularly interested in crawling PDF PostScript files Microsoft Word including their zipped formats Because of this general open source crawlers such as Heritrix must be customized to filter out other MIME types or a middleware is used to extract these documents out and import them to the focused crawl database and repository Identifying whether these documents are academic or not is challenging and can add a significant overhead to the crawling process so this is performed as a post crawling process using machine learning or regular expression algorithms These academic documents are usually obtained from home pages of faculties and students or from publication page of research institutes Because academic documents takes only a small fraction in the entire web pages a good seed selection are important in boosting the efficiencies of these web crawlers Other academic crawlers may download plain text and HTML files that contains metadata of academic papers such as titles papers and abstracts This increases the overall number of papers but a significant fraction may not provide free PDF downloads The Web has a very dynamic nature and crawling a fraction of the Web can take weeks or months By the time a Web crawler has finished its crawl many events could have happened including creations updates and deletions From the search engines point of view there is a cost associated with not detecting an event and thus having an outdated copy of a resource The mostused cost functions are freshness and age Freshness This is a binary measure that indicates whether the local copy is accurate or not The freshness of a page p in the repository at time t is defined as Age This is a measure that indicates how outdated the local copy is The age of a page p in the repository at time t is defined as Coffman et al worked with a definition of the objective of a Web crawler that is equivalent to freshness but use a different wording they propose that a crawler must minimize the fraction of time pages remain outdated They also noted that the problem of Web crawling can be modeled as a multiplequeue singleserver polling system on which the Web crawler is the server and the Web sites are the queues Page modifications are the arrival of the customers and switchover times are the interval between page accesses to a single Web site Under this model mean waiting time for a customer in the polling system is equivalent to the average age for the Web crawler The objective of the crawler is to keep the average freshness of pages in its collection as high as possible or to keep the average age of pages as low as possible These objectives are not equivalent in the first case the crawler is just concerned with how many pages are outdated while in the second case the crawler is concerned with how old the local copies of pages are Two simple revisiting policies were studied by Cho and GarciaMolina In both cases the repeated crawling order of pages can be done either in a random or a fixed order Cho and GarciaMolina proved the surprising result that in terms of average freshness the uniform policy outperforms the proportional policy in both a simulated Web and a real Web crawl Intuitively the reasoning is that as web crawlers have a limit to how many pages they can crawl in a given time frame they will allocate too many new crawls to rapidly changing pages at the expense of less frequently updating pages and the freshness of rapidly changing pages lasts for shorter period than that of less frequently changing pages In other words a proportional policy allocates more resources to crawling frequently updating pages but experiences less overall freshness time from them To improve freshness the crawler should penalize the elements that change too often The optimal revisiting policy is neither the uniform policy nor the proportional policy The optimal method for keeping average freshness high includes ignoring the pages that change too often and the optimal for keeping average age low is to use access frequencies that monotonically and sublinearly increase with the rate of change of each page In both cases the optimal is closer to the uniform policy than to the proportional policy as Coffman et al note in order to minimize the expected obsolescence time the accesses to any particular page should be kept as evenly spaced as possible Explicit formulas for the revisit policy are not attainable in general but they are obtained numerically as they depend on the distribution of page changes Cho and GarciaMolina show that the exponential distribution is a good fit for describing page changes while Ipeirotis et al show how to use statistical tools to discover parameters that affect this distribution Note that the revisiting policies considered here regard all pages as homogeneous in terms of quality all pages on the Web are worth the same something that is not a realistic scenario so further information about the Web page quality should be included to achieve a better crawling policy Crawlers can retrieve data much quicker and in greater depth than human searchers so they can have a crippling impact on the performance of a site Needless to say if a single crawler is performing multiple requests per second andor downloading large files a server would have a hard time keeping up with requests from multiple crawlers As noted by Koster the use of Web crawlers is useful for a number of tasks but comes with a price for the general community The costs of using Web crawlers include A partial solution to these problems is the robots exclusion protocol also known as the robotstxt protocol that is a standard for administrators to indicate which parts of their Web servers should not be accessed by crawlers This standard does not include a suggestion for the interval of visits to the same server even though this interval is the most effective way of avoiding server overload Recently commercial search engines like Google Ask Jeeves MSN and Yahoo Search are able to use an extra Crawldelay parameter in the robotstxt file to indicate the number of seconds to delay between requests The first proposed interval between successive pageloads was seconds However if pages were downloaded at this rate from a website with more than pages over a perfect connection with zero latency and infinite bandwidth it would take more than months to download only that entire Web site also only a fraction of the resources from that Web server would be used This does not seem acceptable Cho uses seconds as an interval for accesses and the WIRE crawler uses seconds as the default The MercatorWeb crawler follows an adaptive politeness policy if it took t seconds to download a document from a given server the crawler waits for t seconds before downloading the next page Dill et al use second For those using Web crawlers for research purposes a more detailed costbenefit analysis is needed and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deciding where to crawl and how fast to crawl Anecdotal evidence from access logs shows that access intervals from known crawlers vary between seconds and minutes It is worth noticing that even when being very polite and taking all the safeguards to avoid overloading Web servers some complaints from Web server administrators are received Brin and Page note that running a crawler which connects to more than half a million servers generates a fair amount of email and phone calls Because of the vast number of people coming on line there are always those who do not know what a crawler is because this is the first one they have seen A parallel crawler is a crawler that runs multiple processes in parallel The goal is to maximize the download rate while minimizing the overhead from parallelization and to avoid repeated downloads of the same page To avoid downloading the same page more than once the crawling system requires a policy for assigning the new URLs discovered during the crawling process as the same URL can be found by two different crawling processes A crawler must not only have a good crawling strategy as noted in the previous sections but it should also have a highly optimized architecture Shkapenyuk and Suel noted that While it is fairly easy to build a slow crawler that downloads a few pages per second for a short period of time building a highperformance system that can download hundreds of millions of pages over several weeks presents a number of challenges in system design IO and network efficiency and robustness and manageability Web crawlers are a central part of search engines and details on their algorithms and architecture are kept as business secrets When crawler designs are published there is often an important lack of detail that prevents others from reproducing the work There are also emerging concerns about search engine spamming which prevent major search engines from publishing their ranking algorithms While most of the website owners are keen to have their pages indexed as broadly as possible to have strong presence in search engines web crawling can also have unintended consequences and lead to a compromise or data breach if search engine indexes resources that shouldnt be publicly available or pages revealing potentially vulnerable versions of software Apart from standard web application security recommendations website owners can reduce their exposure to opportunistic hacking by only allowing search engines to index the public parts of their websites with robotstxt and explicitly blocking them from indexing transactional parts login pages private pages etc Web crawlers typically identify themselves to a Web server by using the Useragent field of an HTTP request Web site administrators typically examine their Web servers log and use the user agent field to determine which crawlers have visited the web server and how often The user agent field may include a URL where the Web site administrator may find out more information about the crawler Examining Web server log is tedious task and therefore some administrators use tools to identify track and verify Web crawlers Spambots and other malicious Web crawlers are unlikely to place identifying information in the user agent field or they may mask their identity as a browser or other wellknown crawler It is important for Web crawlers to identify themselves so that Web site administrators can contact the owner if needed In some cases crawlers may be accidentally trapped in a crawler trap or they may be overloading a Web server with requests and the owner needs to stop the crawler Identification is also useful for administrators that are interested in knowing when they may expect their Web pages to be indexed by a particular search engine A vast amount of web pages lie in the deep or invisible web These pages are typically only accessible by submitting queries to a database and regular crawlers are unable to find these pages if there are no links that point to them Googles Sitemaps protocol and mod oai are intended to allow discovery of these deepWeb resources Deep web crawling also multiplies the number of web links to be crawled Some crawlers only take some of the URLs in ahrefURL form In some cases such as the Googlebot Web crawling is done on all text contained inside the hypertext content tags or text Strategic approaches may be taken to target deep Web content With a technique called screen scraping specialized software may be customized to automatically and repeatedly query a given Web form with the intention of aggregating the resulting data Such software can be used to span multiple Web forms across multiple Websites Data extracted from the results of one Web form submission can be taken and applied as input to another Web form thus establishing continuity across the Deep Web in a way not possible with traditional web crawlers Pages built on AJAX are among those causing problems to web crawlers Google has proposed a format of AJAX calls that their bot can recognize and index A recent study based on a large scale analysis of robotstxt files showed that certain web crawlers were preferred over others with Googlebot being the most preferred web crawler There are a number of visual web scrapercrawler products available on the web which will crawl pages and structure data into columns and rows based on the users requirements One of the main difference between a classic and a visual crawler is the level of programming ability required to set up a crawler The latest generation of visual scrapers like Diffbot outwithub and importio remove the majority of the programming skill needed to be able to program and start a crawl to scrape web data The visual scrapingcrawling methodology relies on the user teaching a piece of crawler technology which then follows patterns in semistructured data sources The dominant method for teaching a visual crawler is by highlighting data in a browser and training columns and rows While the technology is not new for example it was the basis of Needlebase which has been bought by Google as part of a larger acquisition of ITA Labs there is continued growth and investment in this area by investors and endusers The following is a list of published crawler architectures for generalpurpose crawlers excluding focused web crawlers with a brief description that includes the names given to the different components and outstanding features In addition to the specific crawler architectures listed above there are general crawler architectures published by Cho and Chakrabarti
